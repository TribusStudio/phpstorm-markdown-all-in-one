Editor–preview scroll synchronization and architectural toolbar fix.


### 9A — Editor–Preview Scroll Synchronization ✅
- [x] Add `data-source-line` attributes to block-level HTML elements during markdown→HTML conversion
- [x] Editor→Preview sync: `VisibleAreaListener` on editor sends top visible line to JCEF via JavaScript `scrollToSourceLine()`
- [x] Preview→Editor sync: JavaScript scroll event reports visible source line back to Kotlin via `JBCefJSQuery`
- [x] Scroll-lock flag to prevent feedback loops (editor sets flag before programmatic preview scroll, and vice versa)
- [x] Debounce/throttle scroll events (50ms JS debounce + 200ms flag reset) to avoid excessive updates
- [x] Only active in split mode (both panels visible)
- [x] Settings toggle: "Synchronize editor and preview scroll position" (enabled by default)
- [x] Tests for source-line annotation in HTML converter output (11 new test cases)

### 9B — Toolbar Architecture Rewrite ✅

- [x] Toolbar created synchronously in constructor — zero-latency, no notification system
- [x] Remove `EditorToolbarProvider` (the `EditorNotificationProvider` implementation)
- [x] Remove `ToolbarInitListener` (`FileEditorManagerListener` workaround)
- [x] Remove hierarchy listener hacks for window move/split/combine
- [x] Toolbar respects `toolbarEnabled` and `toolbarDisplayMode` settings
- [x] Toolbar updates on settings change via `MarkdownSettings.ChangeListener`
- [x] Floating toolbar (selection popup) remains unchanged — it's architecturally sound
- [x] Verify toolbar survives split/unsplit, tab drag, window move, group operations
- [x] Tests for toolbar presence and button state

## Phase 10: Math & LaTeX Support ✅
Full math editing and rendering to match VSCode parity.

- [x] Toggle Math action (`Ctrl+M`) — cycles: no math → `$...$` (inline) → `$$...$$` (display)
- [x] Toggle Math Reverse action (command palette) — cycles in opposite direction
- [x] KaTeX rendering in preview — bundled KaTeX JS/CSS library in JCEF, render `$...$` and `$$...$$` as formatted equations via auto-render
- [x] Math-aware syntax highlighting — annotator patterns for `$` and `$$` delimiters, distinct text attributes for math delimiters and content
- [x] Math completion provider — LaTeX command autocompletion inside math environments (170+ commands: Greek letters, operators, relations, arrows, symbols, accents, delimiters, environments)
- [x] Build toolbar button for math functions
- [x] Include Math functions in right-click menu markdown options
- [x] Include Math functions in hamburger menu in toolbar
- [x] Settings: `mathEnabled` toggle (enabled by default)
- [x] Tests for math toggle action, math rendering, and math completions (20 new test cases)

## Phase 11: Advanced List Editing ✅

- [x] Toggle List action — cycle current line through marker candidates (`-`, `*`, `+`, `1.`, `1)`)
- [x] Configurable marker candidates setting (`listToggleCandidates`)
- [x] Move line up/down (`Alt+Up/Down`) with ordered list auto-renumber
- [x] Copy line up/down (`Shift+Alt+Up/Down`) with ordered list auto-renumber
- [x] `Ctrl+Enter` to exit list continuation (insert plain line)
- [x] `Shift+Enter` for soft break within list item (trailing double-space + newline)
- [x] Tab/Shift+Tab for list indent/outdent (context-aware: list vs table)
- [x] Ordered list marker style setting — "ordered" (incrementing: 1. 2. 3.) vs "one" (always 1.)
- [x] Ordered list auto-renumbering after indent/outdent
- [x] Toolbar icons — unordered list and ordered list icons with dark variants; Toggle List button added to editor toolbar
- [x] Tests for toggle list, ordered list renumbering, and marker parsing

## Phase 12: Editor Decorations & Visual Theming ✅
Visual decorations in the editor (not just preview) for richer editing experience.

- [x] Code span background — inline `code` gets visible background tint in the editor (light/dark aware)
- [x] Strikethrough rendering — `~~text~~` shown with actual STRIKEOUT text effect in editor
- [x] Formatting mark dimming — `**`, `~~`, `*`, `_` markers rendered in muted foreground color
- [x] Trailing space shading — trailing whitespace highlighted with background color
- [x] Hard line break indicator — trailing double-space highlighted with distinct blue-tinted background
- [x] Link visual distinction — separate styling for link text vs URL portion (existing from Phase 1)
- [x] Per-decoration toggle settings (enable/disable each decoration type individually)
- [x] Color Settings Page — Settings > Editor > Color Scheme > Markdown for full theme customization
- [x] Decoration file size limit setting — skip decorations on files larger than configurable threshold
- [x] Tests for decoration colors, patterns, and TextAttributesKey definitions

## Phase 13: Export & Preview Polish ✅
Minor export improvements and preview conveniences.

- [x] Auto-export on save — `exportOnSave` setting with `FileDocumentManagerListener` to generate HTML alongside `.md` on save
- [x] HTML title from comment — `<!-- title: Your Title -->` sets `<title>` in exported HTML (highest priority, before heading extraction)
- [x] `.md` → `.html` link conversion in export — `convertMdLinksToHtml()` rewrites internal markdown links, preserving anchor fragments
- [x] Pure HTML export mode — `exportPureCss` setting skips all theme and custom CSS in the exported document
- [x] Auto-show preview on file open — `autoShowPreview` setting controls whether split editor starts in split or editor-only mode
- [x] Zola slug mode — `slugifyZola()` with alphanumeric + hyphen + underscore, collapsed hyphens, trimmed edges
- [x] Tests for title extraction, link conversion, Zola slugs, and export options

## Phase 14: Diagram Rendering (Mermaid & Beyond) ← NEXT
Render diagram code blocks as visual diagrams in the preview.

- [ ] Mermaid diagram rendering — detect ```` ```mermaid ```` blocks, render via embedded Mermaid.js in JCEF
- [ ] PlantUML rendering — detect ```` ```plantuml ```` blocks, render via PlantUML library or server
- [ ] Graceful fallback — show raw code if rendering library fails to load
- [ ] Diagram theme integration — diagrams respect the selected preview theme (light/dark)
- [ ] Tests for diagram detection and rendering

## Phase 15: Table Column & Row Operations ✅
Advanced table editing to match JetBrains bundled plugin parity.

- [x] Go To Symbol support — headings searchable via `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+N` (`ChooseByNameContributorEx`)
- [x] Code folding — collapsible regions for headings, code fences, front matter, and long blockquotes (`FoldingBuilderEx`)
- [x] Breadcrumb support — show heading path in editor breadcrumb bar (`BreadcrumbsInfoProvider`)
- [x] Tests for structure view tree building, folding patterns, and breadcrumb path resolution

## Phase 17: IncrementalDOM Preview & Performance
Replace full HTML replacement with efficient DOM patching for large document performance.

- [ ] Implement IncrementalDOM-based preview updates — parse HTML diff, generate JS patch calls
- [ ] Preserve scroll position across preview updates (no flicker on edit)
- [ ] Preview static server — serve local resources via `httpRequestHandler` instead of `file://` URLs
- [ ] CSP headers and security hardening for preview content
- [ ] Debounced preview updates with visual loading indicator for very large documents
- [ ] Performance benchmarks: measure preview update latency for 100/500/1000/5000-line documents
- [ ] Tests for incremental update correctness

## Phase 18: Preview Navigation & Link Handling
Browser-style navigation within the JCEF preview, with configurable link behavior.

- [ ] Preview link behavior setting — choose between "Open in editor" (current: opens linked `.md` files in PHPStorm editor) and "Browser-style" (navigates within the JCEF preview like a web browser)
- [ ] Browser-style navigation — render linked `.md` files directly in the JCEF preview panel with full HTML conversion
- [ ] Document history stack — track visited documents for back/forward navigation within the preview
- [ ] Back/Forward toolbar buttons — visible navigation bar when in browser-style mode (existing `createNavBar()` infrastructure)
- [ ] "Return to source" button — return from browsed document to the file open in the editor
- [ ] Breadcrumb trail — show navigation path of visited documents in the preview toolbar
- [ ] Anchor fragment support — when navigating to `file.md#heading`, scroll to the heading after loading
- [ ] Relative path resolution — resolve `../`, `./`, and nested paths correctly in both modes
- [ ] Non-markdown file handling — open non-`.md` links (images, PDFs, etc.) in appropriate IDE viewer or system app
- [ ] Tests for link resolution, history stack, and navigation mode switching

## Phase 19: Extension Point Architecture
Open the plugin for third-party extensions.

- [ ] Define `previewExtensionProvider` EP — inject JS/CSS into JCEF preview (for math, diagrams, custom renderers)
- [ ] Define `fenceLanguageProvider` EP — map custom info strings to rendering logic
- [ ] Define `exportProvider` EP — additional export formats (PDF, DOCX)
- [ ] Define `markdownFlavourProvider` EP — override parsing behavior per file
- [ ] All extension points marked `dynamic="true"` for hot-swap
- [ ] Documentation for extension point API (contributor guide)
- [ ] Migrate built-in math/diagram support to use own extension points (dogfooding)
- [ ] Tests for extension point loading and lifecycle

## Phase 20: Language Injection in Code Fences
Full IDE language support inside fenced code blocks (JetBrains' marquee feature).

- [ ] `MultiHostInjector` implementation for code fence content ranges
- [ ] Map fence info strings to IntelliJ `Language` instances (with alias resolution)
- [ ] Syntax highlighting from target language inside code fences in the editor
- [ ] Completion from target language inside code fences
- [ ] Error highlighting toggle (`showProblemsInCodeBlocks` setting) — opt-in to avoid noise
- [ ] Proper PSI range mapping between fence content and injected language fragments
- [ ] Tests for injection activation, highlighting, and completion in common languages (Kotlin, Java, SQL, JSON, HTML)

## Phase 21: Project-Level Settings & Advanced Configuration
Per-project markdown configuration for multi-project workflows.

- [ ] Migrate settings from application-level to project-level (`Service.Level.PROJECT`)
- [ ] Update all `getInstance()` calls to `getInstance(project)`
- [ ] Settings inheritance — project settings override application defaults
- [ ] Front matter parsing — extract YAML/TOML metadata for document properties
- [ ] Registry keys for experimental features (boundary scroll, etc.)
- [ ] Settings import/export for team sharing
- [ ] Tests for project-level settings isolation

## Phase 22: Marketplace Screenshots & Release
Final marketing assets and JetBrains Marketplace submission. Only after the plugin is battle-tested and peer-reviewed.

- [ ] Create `docs/screenshots/` directory for all marketing assets
- [ ] Capture required screenshots (see docs/005-marketplace-assets.md for full list)
- [ ] Create 1-2 animated GIFs demonstrating key workflows
- [ ] Update README.md with inline screenshots
- [ ] Update plugin description in plugin.xml with screenshot references (raw GitHub URLs)
- [ ] Document screenshot capture instructions for future updates
- [ ] Final peer review and community feedback round
- [ ] JetBrains Marketplace submission

## Phase 23: Addendums & UX Polish ✅
Fixes and additions identified during real-world usage.

- [x] Fix floating selection toolbar — rewrote using platform `ActionToolbar` + `JBPopup` with debounce timer for reliable display
- [x] Insert Link action (`Ctrl+K`) — dialog with text, URL, and optional title fields; pre-fills selected text
- [x] Insert Image action (`Ctrl+Shift+K`) — dialog with alt text, image path/URL, and optional title fields
- [x] Link and image toolbar icons (chain link + landscape) with dark variants
- [x] Link and image buttons in editor toolbar, floating toolbar, and right-click context menu

## Phase 24: Context-Sensitive Floating Toolbar ✅
Show different toolbar actions based on the selection context instead of a generic formatting palette.

- [x] Context detection engine (`SelectionContext`) — analyzes selection and surrounding text to determine context
- [x] **Default context** (plain text) — Bold, Italic, Strikethrough, Code, Heading Up/Down, Link, Image
- [x] **TOC context** — selection overlaps `<!-- TOC -->...<!-- /TOC -->` → Update TOC, Add/Remove Section Numbers
- [x] **Table context** — selection inside table rows → Format Table, Insert/Delete Row/Column
- [x] **Code block context** — selection inside fenced code block → Toggle Code Block (unwrap)
- [x] **Math context** — selection inside `$...$` or `$$...$$` → Toggle Math, Toggle Math Reverse
- [x] **Blockquote** — moved to default toolbar (blockquote operates on lines, so it coexists with inline formatting)
- [x] Context priority rules: TOC > Code Block > Table > Math > Default
- [x] Settings toggle — `contextSensitiveToolbar` (default on), falls back to default toolbar when off
- [x] Tests for TOC detection, code block detection, math detection, and priority rules

## Future Considerations
- Custom markdown-it extensions integration
- Multi-language support (i18n beyond English)
- Vim mode compatibility
- R Markdown / Quarto language support
- GFM Alerts rendering (NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT, WARNING, CAUTION)
- PDF/DOCX export via extension point providers
- Stub-based indexing for fast heading navigation without full AST parsing
- Spellcheck integration with markdown-aware word boundaries
